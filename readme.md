### Glossary

>**Terms**.

Single words

>**Phrases**

Sentences defined by line breaks.

### Study Methodology 

Study methodology: 

-> Download file  
-> Go through the list of terms and phrases to delete all trivial and invalid terms  
-> Translate leftover items and note all important information for study  
-> Alternate studying of terms and phrases with listening to the song until understanding is satisfactory  

### Application Behavior 

- during manual entry of
lyrics, line breaks are only recognized if the 'enter' key
is used explicitly

(to be expanded on later...)

### General information

This was supposed to include an automatic translation 
function via an api, however, it turns out that the veracity of the 
free translation options tried (e.g. Yandex) were not satisfactory 
in their accuracy. A higher quality translation solution (e.g. DeepL api)
could be an alternative.

It will nonetheless be a learning benefit to the student to research
the terms and sentences on their own to attain a better understanding
of the different possible variations in meaning. 

The result set might contain the same word with differing capitalization.
This might be a legitimate circumstance in the language. In case it is not,
this could be mitigated programmatically. This entails however the two 
problems of detecting when this is illegitimate and if so, which of the
two is correct. It is thus left to the user to discern during their study
what is right.
