This was supposed to include an automatic translation 
function via an api, however, it turns out that the veracity of the 
free translation options tried (e.g. Yandex) were not satisfactory 
in their accuracy. A higher quality translation solution (e.g. DeepL api)
could be an alternative.

It will nonetheless be a learning benefit to the student to research
the terms and sentences on their own to attain a better understanding
of the different possible variations in meaning. 


The result set might contain the same word with differing capitalization.
This might be a legitimate cicumstance in the language. Incase it is not,
this could be mitigated programmatically. This entails however the two 
problems of detecting when this is illigitimate and if so, which of the 
two is correct. It is thus left to the user to discern during their study
what is right.

Watch out!

Some websites will include extra promotional annotiation when
you copy and paste lyrics of them
